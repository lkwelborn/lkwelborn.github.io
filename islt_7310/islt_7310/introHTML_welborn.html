    <title>Welcome to Kate Welborn's Website</title>

<body>
    
    My name is Kate Welborn, although you will see my name display as Lauren â€“ I am a middle-namer.  I currently work as a public defender in rural Missouri, but I worked in the Mizzou Engineering and Law Libraries when I was an on-campus student in the late 90s and early 00s.

    I am in this class completely new to the world of web application and development, but I have always been interested in the topic.  I hope to gain a basic working knowledge of HTML and CSS in this course and try to weasel my way into the IT side of my current workplace.  I hope that I am able to hone my web development skills enough to have a bit of a side hustle, and simply have another practical skill to apply.

    Since it is summertime, my current favorite hobbies are kayaking the rivers of the Ozarks and growing impressive vegetables in my garden beds.
